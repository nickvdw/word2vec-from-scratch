        "In this notebook, we explore the model proposed by Mikolov et al. in [1]. We will build the Skipgram and CBOW models from scratch, train them on a relatively small corpus, and take a closer look at some analogies using these trained models. We will look at three different number of dimensions of the word embeddings in order to get a better intuition how the number of dimensions influences the result. The goal is not to obtain a high performance. Rather, the goal is to get a better understanding of the models. For that reason, Skipgram does not use negative sampling even though it would be used in practice.\n",

        "We observe that the loss decreases very slowly. Moreover, we observe a slowly increasing accuracy. We use accuracy as a metric, so that we can get sort of an idea of when to stop. The bad thing about our approach is that we train all models for an equal number of epochs this way when that is not necessarily the best course of action, but let us not focus too much on this now as the training does not take that long anyway and we just want to create word embeddings. We used an equal number of epochs for all models to make it easier to compare the losses and accuracies of the different models at equal numbers of epochs. After 12 epochs for the model that considers 50 dimensions, we observe that the accuracy does not increase significantly anymore (even decreases a bit during one epoch). This can also be observed for the model with 150 dimensions after epoch 6. For the model with 300 dimensions, we can already stop after 4 epochs since the accuracy only keeps decreasing. Hence, we observe that training these models for more epochs does not necessarily lead to a better accuracy.\n",

Our corpus, namely `alice.txt`, has only 26,283 words before processing the file, which is a lot less than the millions of words that are mentioned by Mikolov et al. in [1]. We suspect that this results in our models simply not being able to learn much from our corpus. This is highlighted even more by Mikolov et al. [1] in  tables 2 and 3 in [1]. Since we trained our models on a relatively small corpus, low accuracies were to be expected. Rezaeinia et al. [3] further support this statement. \n",

        "For the CBOW model, we generate the training data differently compared to how we did it for the Skipgram model. With the CBOW model, we want to predict words based on their context. We do this by using a window around the word we want to predict. In our code, this window is represented by the `window_size`. All words contained in the window are the context words. Note that if we want to predict the first or final few words of a sentence (depends on the window size), it might be the case that our window reaches the previous or next sentence, respectively. In such a case, the window around the target word is restricted to the words that are in the same sentence. In the code, we solve this by using padding, which ensures that all sequences of context words the same length. For the padding, we simply use a value of 0."

This reasoning also applies to why we use Softmax and categorical cross-entropy. Furthermore, `adam` is used as our optimizer for the same reasons given in this section for the Skipgram model. Similar reasoning applies to why we use `glorot_uniform` initializers."

        "**Motivation**. The motivation for training the CBOW models the way we do is equivalent to the motivation given for training the Skipgram models. The only difference between these models and the Skipgram models is that, for these models, we can still see the accuracy increase and loss decrease after several epochs, while this was not the case for the Skipgram models. This is one of the reasons why we train CBOW for more epochs than Skipgram. Furthermore, we can easily increase the number of epochs for these models compared to the ones for Skipgram since CBOW is significantly faster to train than Skipgram. The results of this model together with the Skipgram model will explored further in Task 1.3."

With this function, we want to be able to answer whether an analogy like: \"a king is to a queen as a man is to a woman\" ($e_{king} - e_{queen} + e_{woman} \\approx e_{man}$) is true. In a perfect scenario, we would like that this analogy ($e_{king} - e_{queen} + e_{woman}$) results in the embedding of the word \"man\". However, it does not always result in exactly the same word embedding. In this context, we will call \"man\" the true or the actual word $t$. We want to find the word $p$ in the vocabulary, where the embedding of $p$ ($e_p$) is the closest to the predicted embedding (i.e., the result of the formula). Then, we can check if $p$ is the same word as the true word $t$.  "

        "The method we have created above is relatively simple. Let us consider the major steps of the method. The method boils down to: 1) concatenating all models such that it is easier to iterate over all models, 2) get the embeddings of each model such that we can easily iterate over them, 3) store the model names in a list such that we can easily iterate over them, 4) create a list of tuples of size four where each word in the tuple represents a word in the analogy, 5) iterate over each tuple in the analogies we want to look at, 6) compute the embedding of each word in the tuple, 7) fill in the analogy function using the first three words, 8) make a prediction based on the outcome of the analogy function and return the `nr` nearest words using the cosine distance (we use this distance measure since it was mentioned in [1]), 9) compare if the actual word (given as input parameter) is equal to the predicted word. This is the main idea behind the method. We have also made it easier to return the top `nr` of nearest words and print the top `nr` nearest words for each prediction together with the cosine distances to give us more of an idea as to what the model is predicting.\n",

        "In terms of performance, we observe that none of the six models managed to correctly predict any of the analogies; all predictions were incorrect. The major reason for this concerns the size of our corpus. Our corpus, namely `alice.txt`, has only 26,283 words before processing the file, which is a lot less than the millions of words that are mentioned by Mikolov et al. in [1]. This suggests that our models are simply not able to learn much from our corpus since there is not that much to learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note, however, that for the analogy \"*small* is to *smaller* as *large* is to ? (*larger*)\", SG_150 and SG_300 almost predicted the correct word (the true word was in the top 3 and top 2, respectively). This result can be observed in the output of the code cell above this cell and in the table. Especially SG_300 was extremely close to predicting this word correctly. A possible reason for these almost correct predictions could be due to the fact that this type of analogy is relatively easy to solve compared to some of our other analogies. More specifically, \"small\" and \"smaller\" are very similar because \"smaller\" is simply \"small\" + \"er\", and \"large\" and \"larger\" are very similar because \"larger\" is simply \"large\" + \"r\". While the predictions by the models were not completely correct (these words were not the nearest words), we still thought it would be interesting to mention this fact.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the poor performance of both models on the analogies (on our corpus), it is tough to say which model performs better. To be able to draw sound conclusions on which type of model is more suitable for predicting analogies, we believe that we would require a larger corpus. If we were to draw a conclusion from the results we have right now, we would argue that Skipgram performs slightly better since it almost predicted the correct word twice, as mentioned in the paragraph above. This is supported by a comment from Mikolov in [4], where he, based on his experience, argues that Skipgram works well with a small amount of the training data and represents rare words or phrases well.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the table, we observe that for the lowest dimension (namely `dim=50`), both types of models are more inclined to predict different words than models with larger dimensions (namely `dim=150` and `dim=300`). See, for example, the analogy \"Love is to hate as little is to ?\", where CBOW_150 and CBOW_300 both predicted \"kissed\", while CBOW_50 predicted \"melancholy\". Another example is the analogy \"A man is to a woman as a king is to a ?\", where SG_150 and SG_300 both predicted \"childhood\", while SG_50 predicted \"leave\". This occurrence could stem from the fact that our corpus size is rather small, which results in us suspecting that there are fewer \"features\" to learn from (e.g., fewer diverse words with different meanings in different contexts) than in much larger corpora. Note that this occurrence only happens three times in total. We thought that it would be something interesting enough to mention in this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "We initially ran these methods without excluding the words that were present in the analogy. When we did not exclude these words, we observed that we often predicted one of the three words that were present in the analogy. Intuitively, this makes sense as these words are used in the input and, therefore, heavily influence the result. Based on these experiments and applying some logic, it makes a lot of sense why Mikolov et al. [1] discard the input question words (the words used in the analogy).\n",

Note that in our analysis, we use that $L=2$. The shape of the training samples for CBOW is $(27165, 4)$, which can be seen as $27165$ samples, where each sample contains $4$ (context) words. This means that, for CBOW, the size of the training data equals the total number of words in the corpus. \n",
        "\n",
        "The shape of the training samples for Skipgram is $(94556,)$, which can be seen as $94556$ samples, each containing a single word. This means that, for Skipgram, the size of the training data is slightly less than `n_samples` $\\cdot$ `window_size` $\\cdot 2$ in most cases. The actual size is somewhat less because we cannot capture all words in the full window size for words at the beginning and end of sentences. We will cover this more in the next few paragraphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the information above, we can clearly conclude that Skipgram has more training samples if both CBOW and Skipgram have the same sentences as input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why?\n",
        "Let us consider how the data is generated for each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "In CBOW, we have a training sample for each word we want to predict. This means that the total number of training samples is equal to the total number of words in the corpus. Moreover, each training sample consists of all the words that are contained in a window around the word we want to predict. Let $L$ denote the window size. The total number of words per training sample equals $2L$ after applying padding to make sure each training sample has $2L$ words.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Skipgram, we want to predict the context words based on an input word. In practice, we generated the training samples by specifying a window size $L$ and iterating over all sentences. For each word $w_t$ in the sentence, we add the word pairs $(w_t, w_{t-L}), \\cdots, (w_t, w_{t-1}), (w_t, w_{t+1}), \\cdots (w_t, w_{t+L})$ to the set of training samples. Note that it might not always be possible to make use of the full window size because it might be the case that, for example, at the beginning of a sentence, we cannot consider the $L$ words before the first word of that sentence since these words do not exist in our sentence. (This 'issue' has to do with us considering all words within a certain sentence.) This problem also appears when we consider words at the end of the sentence. This is a reason as to why we have slightly less than the number we proposed above.\n",
        "\n",
        "From these descriptions of the data generation methods for both models, it is evident why Skipgram has more training samples than CBOW for an equal number of sentences with the same content. In conclusion, Skipgram has slightly less than `n_samples` $\\cdot$ `window_size` $\\cdot 2$ samples due to the way the samples are created. On the other hand, CBOW has `n_samples` training samples. Again, the former is larger in size (assuming `window_size` $\\geq 1$)."
